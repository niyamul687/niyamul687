         <p>Traffic jam means a blockage of vehicles on roads and streets for hours. It has already arisen as an urban demon. Transport is at complete stagnation while there is a traffic jam. This stagnation is most common in metropolitan cities, especially in the capital. The causes of this severe problem are many, among which population density is the main one. The other reasons are the increase of all types of vehicles, underdeveloped traffic control systems, illegal parking, illegal occupation, carelessness of the drivers, etc. The effects of traffic jams are also multiple. It causes untold suffering to millions of people. None can reach their destination in time. Their valuable time is wasted. Even an ambulance has to stay standstill, causing the patient's death inside. Some practical steps should be taken to stop traffic jams in the cities. Underground railway, elevated railway, and flyovers must be constructed as early as possible. For a better future, we all must be sincere. Long-term, midterm, and short-term measures should be adopted to minimize the loss and stop it gradually in the future. It is frustrating that reckless drivers can somehow escape punishment. In most cases, they are not even arrested. The reason behind it is an open secret, what's more. The punishment for killing by reckless driving has recently been minimized to imprisonment of only three years. This law should be removed, and the death penalty should be the punishment for killing by reckless driving. In this way, we can reduce the extremity of traffic jams and the amount of loss and suffering caused by it in our cities and towns.</p>
